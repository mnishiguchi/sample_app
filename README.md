## Memo

### Model test

#### Run

```bash
$ bundle exec rake test             # Run all the tests.
$ bundle exec rake test:models      # Run only the model tests.
$ bundle exec rake test:integration # Run only the integration tests.
```

### Integration test

```bash
$ rails generate integration_test site_layout
```

### Database in Rails
http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#rolling-back

#### Database level validation
- [Active Record Migrations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)
- [Database level validation - Be The Better Rails Developer](http://blog.benroux.me/be-the-better-rails-developer)
  + Default and Not Null clauses
  + Column indexing
  + Unique column constraints
  + Foreign keys
  + Update statements
  + Multiple inserts/updates
- [Available field types](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/TableDefinition.html#method-i-column)

#### [Rolling Back](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#rolling-back)

```bash
rake db:rollback
```

- Executes the drop_table command to remove the users table from the database.
- Works only for [reversible migrations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#using-the-change-method) by default.
- In the case of an irreversible migration, such as one to remove a database column, it is necessary to define separate up and down methods in place of the single change method:
  + [Using reversible](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#using-reversible)
  + [Using the up/down Methods](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#using-the-up-down-methods)

### Regular expression
- [The valid email regex](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users#table-valid_email_regex)
- [The Rubular regular expression editor](http://www.rubular.com/)

### Fixtures

- Default fixtures that were generated automatically by Rails sometimes cause a test to fail. Just delete them.

### The method for authenticating users
By comparing hashed values instead of raw passwords, we will be able to authenticate users without storing the passwords themselves. This means that, even if our database is compromised, our usersâ€™ passwords will still be secure.

1. Take a submitted password
2. Hash it
3. Compare the result to the hashed value stored in the database
4. If the two match, then the submitted password is correct and the user is authenticated.
